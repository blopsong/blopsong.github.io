<p>Hey.</p>

<p>Individuals necessitate companions for emotional exchange and the acquisition of fortitude. Unbeknownst to us, our minds engage in a subtle dance with our companions, shaping and reshaping our thoughts in an intricate ballet. When confronted with a pluralitu of individuals, it becomes imperative to recognize the intricate tapestry of thoughts intertwining, transcending the boundaries of singular entities.</p>

<p>Progression, a planar motion confined to two dimensions, unveils its face only when perceived from the vantage point of a third. Scrutinizing the kinematics of our pedestrian locomotion in slow motino unverils that there are only support and telescoping. It becomes more interesting to think about how wheels move forward.</p>

<p>Our confinement to a three-dimensional realm may stem from inherent limitations within the model itself, circomscibing our perception and comprehension.</p>

<p>The gap between expectations and reality is the source of  our sense of loss. In this perspective, keeping low expectations for everything seems to be a contributing factor in dispelling melancholy. But the problem is, desire is the source of motivation and giving it up means death. I have hitherto failed to envision the continuance of cogitation devoid of contrariety.</p>

<p>Humankind requires a way to expense energy, be it through the digital realms of gaming, the fleeting distractions of short-form media, or the myriad pursuits that ignite passions. Its absence marks as precipice toward which my own mortality appears to beckon. To sustain vitality, it is imperative for me to liberate emotions in some domains.</p>

<p>Do you know <strong>game of lifes</strong>? I&#8217;ve got some enlightenment that perhaps rules could serve as the foundational pillars.</p>

<p>Poe&#8217;s quill dances with literary grace.</p>

<p>If you think that there is no mystery behind the characteristics of living things and that it &quot;just is the way it is&quot;, then we have nothing to say between us.</p>

<p>The cosmos resides within my consciousness.</p>

<p>A sentence says that <em>keep low expectation for anything</em>. I recalled it when I was about to get upset. I couldn&#8217;t agree with it more right now. And it also means to be aloof.</p>

<p>I hate authoritativeness and authority.</p>

<p>I desire to bestow equity upon all, yet I am confronted with the disconcerting realization that many are unworthy of such a gift, we are not the same. It would appear that the very existence of authority is a fruit of the inherent pusillanimity of humankind.</p>

<p>I looked at the intertwined mathematical symbols and words, and suddenly realized that, like religion, mathematics is about spreading ideas. For the first time in decades, I got this perspective.</p>

<p>All individuals harbor biases, and I am no exception. However, I find myself particularly irked by my own susceptibility to succumbing to such inclinations.</p>

<p>I yearn to identify an endeavor worthy of my unwavering dedication and boundless enthusiasm. These people&#8217;s lives are full of shit.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding our whereabouts, an emptiness perpetually resides within.</p>

<p>My introspective viewpoint is rendered somewhat peculiar by the cultural milieu in which I was immersed during my formative years.</p>

<p>I increasingly feel that language is the forerunner and <strong>master</strong> of thought. Each of my actions is the interwined result of instinct and self-directing.</p>

<p>Focus, a scarce commodity, is something I must devise a strategy to acquire.</p>

<p>An elder once told us that it&#8217;s better to walk more and not rely on transportation. I think it&#8217;s a great idea.</p>

<p>People&#8217;s powerful and irresistible drive often comes when they are pressured by external forces. If we explore the process behind this, could it be that a strong idea is formed by the integration of messages received from the outside world and one&#8217;s own thoughts? Putting oneself in this situation, there is a thought in the mind that &#8217;if this is not done, then such an event will occur, which is unacceptable,&#8217; which seems to be the direct source of our strong drive at that time. I am currently like this, no, I have always been like this. This kind of forward movement in a negative way is interesting, and it seems reasonable. But I have decided to try to obtain a directive, proactive way of moving forward, which seems to be what is called executive ability.</p>

<p>I am collecting those events that make me exceptionally weak.</p>

<p>Some people may feel lethargic when they just return from a holiday. Considering a similar phenomenon during my high school days, I wonder if most people are like this. Back in high school, it was due to feeling tired of the repetition, and perhaps these day-to-day workers are also the same.</p>

<p>If I only consider the effects of each action, my desires will be ignored. Humans are creatures that rely on desires to survive. Placing reason above all is simply pronouncing the death of oneself.</p>

<p>From our surroundings, we continuously absorb and transform everything. To achieve our goals, it is necessary to create a suitable environment for ourselves.</p>

<p>Desire is the eternal void at the center of the human body. What a great insight.</p>

<p>Which freezes faster, water at a high temperature or water at a low temperature, under the same environmental conditions? I think this is a question similar to comparing the falling speeds of stones with different weights.</p>

<p>I am easily provoked.</p>

<p>This is the first time I admire someone&#8217;s speech ability. Steve Klabnik, he is so good,</p>

<p>If you can&#8217;t programm without Internet, you have skill issue. I agree with that.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve heard <strong>tmux</strong> many times before but not yet knew what it is util watched a video yestoday. And I just found out that, wow, I could do such a thing or make such a tool to convenient myself because I used to switch among terminal emulator windows by switching among workplaces created by a titling window manager(et. Hyprland). That is where new idea comes from.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>憧れは理解から最も遠い感情だよ</p>

<p>&quot;As all these results were obtained, not by any heroic method, but by patient and detailed reasoning, I began to think it probable that philosophy had erred in adopting heroic remedies for intellectual difficulties, and that solutions were to be found merely by greater care and accuracy. This view I have come to hold more and more strongly as time went on, and it has led me to doubt whether philosophy, as a study distinct from science and possessed of a method of its own, is anything more than an unfortunate legacy from theology.&quot;</p>

<p>-- Bertrand Russell, &quot;Logical Atomism&quot;</p>

<p>I recall that when MIT stopped teaching with SICP, one of the main claims was that programming now is often not about thinking abstractions through from first principles, and creating some isolated gem of composing definitions.</p>

<p>Which is a category mistake that they actually address in the lectures. SICP is not a programming course, it’s a computer science course. Computer science is not about computers, let alone programming, just as geometry is not about surveying instruments and astronomy is not about telescopes.</p>

<p>When they stopped teaching SICP — in response to the pressure to teach more modern tools — they abandoned their scientific principles to satisfy commercial concerns. They stopped teaching computer science and became a vocational school for the tech industry. -- hacker news chongli</p>

<p>If you watch the lecture videos they make it a point of emphasis that they’re not interested in teaching LISP and that the course is not a LISP course. To show running programs they had to select some programming language. This was a regrettable concession because some students will inevitably think the course is about that language and miss the general principles they’re trying to teach:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Primitive operations</li>

<li>Means of combination</li>

<li>Means of abstraction</li>
</ol>

<p>These are the three main features of programming languages, according to Sussman and Abelson. They wanted us to stop bikeshedding over the superficial details and just look at a tool for these 3 features, then be able to implement the algorithms and data structures we already know. This is how you become a wizard who can cast magic spells.  -- hacker news chongli</p>

<p>The goal of the course is not to teach programming skills, it&#8217;s to teach computer science. The difference is explained quite thoroughly in the lectures. One might even say that answering the question &quot;what is computer science?&quot; is one of the core goals of the course and a major part of the philosophy of the professors who created the course.</p>

<p>The argument being made by the comparisons to geometry and astronomy is that in any discipline there is a difference between means and ends: what you are attempting to achieve is distinct from the tools you&#8217;re using to achieve it. Furthermore, it&#8217;s a mistake to believe that the discipline is all about the tools. No, the tools are the means, not the end. --hacker news chongli</p>

<p>The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology — the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of “what is.” Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of “how to.”</p>

<p>Q: How did Alan Turing prove that the Turing machine is able to compute any computable problems? A: How would he prove this? First of all you need a precise definition of what computable means. That is exactly what he did when introducing Turing machines. Basically this is what is mechanically computable with a pen and a sheet of paper. Turing realized that you don’t need 2-dimensional paper but a 1-dimensional tape would be enough but its size should not be limited. Also you can only distinguish a finite set of symbols, the tape can be decomposed into cells containing one symbol and in one step you can move only left or right one cell and you have a finite set of states the control can be in. However, there were other notions of computability like Church’s lambda calculus. Church and Turing showed that the two notions of computability coincide giving rise to the Church-Turing thesis that all realistic notions of computability coincide. However, this is not a mathematical theorem since the notion of “realistic notion of computability” is inherently vague.</p>

<p>&quot;A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.&quot; -– Max Planck</p>

<p>I am not in competition with anyone but myself. My goal is to improve myself continuously. -- Bill Gates</p>

<p>The trend also reflects a different concept of competitiveness, argues Samy Chaar, chief economist at the bank Lombard Odier. “Americans are striving for innovation productivity, which is investment-led, while the rest of the world seems to be in another economic logic,” he says. “They are very much more focused on cost competitiveness.”</p>

<p>People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware. --Alan Kay</p>

<p>&quot;Just because your doctor has a name for your condition, doesn&#8217;t mean he knows what it is.&quot; ~ Franz Kafka</p>

<p>&quot;Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things.&quot;[As opposed to the quotation: Poetry is the art of giving different names to the same thing.] ~ Henri Poincare</p>

<p>&quot;It is by logic that we prove, but by intuition that we discover. To know how to criticize is good, to know how to create is better.&quot; ~ Henri Poincare</p>

<p>&quot;The scientist does not study nature because it is useful; he studies it because he delights in it, and he delights in it because it is beautiful.&quot; ~ Henri Poincare</p>

<p>&quot;Doubt everything or believe everything: these are two equally convenient strategies. With either we dispense with the need for reflection.&quot; ~ Henri Poincare</p>

<p>&quot;Geometry is the art of correct reasoning from incorrectly drawn figures.&quot; ~ Henri Poincare</p>

<p>&quot;There are no solved problems; there are only problems that are more or less solved.&quot; ~ Henri Poincare</p>

<p>&quot;Mathematicians do not study objects, but relations among objects; they are indifferent to the replacement of objects by others as long the relations don&#8217;t change. Matter is not important, only form interests them.&quot; ~ Henri Poincare</p>

<p>&quot;A reality completely independent of the spirit that conceives it, sees it, or feels it, is an impossibility. A world so external as that, even if it existed, would be forever inaccessible to us.&quot; ~ Henri Poincare</p>
